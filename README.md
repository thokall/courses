## Editing instruction

### To keep the main folder from getting cluttered
Please create a single folder for your course and inside this folder create a folder for the current instance of the course. Ex:

```
# create a folder for the course as a whole
$ mkdir myNiceCourse

# create a folder for this instance of the course
$ mkdir myNiceCourse/November2015

# now put all the files for this course instance inside the `November2015` folder.
```

If it's a one-off course occation that will not repeat itself, please put it in the `misc` folder.
